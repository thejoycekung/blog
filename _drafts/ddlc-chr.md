*_Warning: Spoilers, mentions of suicide and self-harm._*

If you like to play games, or enjoy playing visual novels, you've probably heard of Doki Doki Literature Club (DDLC) by now. [Insert acclamations, awards]

DDLC, at first glance, is your classic dating simulator visual novel. You play as a student who likes anime and video games, and dislikes socializing (sound like your real life yet?). You're friendly enough with the girl next door - Sayori - and she convinces you to join a club. Her club. The Literature Club! The Literature Club consists of four girls: Sayori, your friend who's the vice-president; Monika, the #perfect girl in class who's the president; Yuri and Natsuki, two other girls who have found their way in. Yuri enjoys darker, more sophisticated literature, while Natsuki likes cute things and more simpler ways to express herself.

To woo the various girls in the club, each night you're tasked with writing a "poem" by selecting words. Each word is associated with a girl (e.g. picking a "cute" word will grant you points with Natsuki), and you'll have the chance to have a special scene with the girl who's most swayed by your poem.

... And that's about where things start to go awry.
