# (Hopefully) One Last Week of Interviews

So reading week is over now, and we're back into the school grind. Rankings for this 'main round' of applications come out on Friday, and I've been lucky enough to be granted two interviews these last two days before.

I also had the chance to find out that I won't be moving to Redmond this summer, for sure, to work with Microsoft. Although immensely saddening because, well, Explore seemed like the *perfect* program for a first-year who had no idea what she wanted and moving to a city far away from her support circle seemed alluring to force herself to grow up and all -
I'm not entirely sure I'm ready for that yet. So working for a Big 4 company like Microsoft ... it can wait. I'll have my chance at Cali or bust sometime over these next five years.

Today I had a chance to interview with a position for the University, and even though it's not a technical/dev job ... I walked out of that interview feeling really positive about that job (almost as excited as I was when I first applied). It's to be the Assistant to the Director of Women in Computer Science (a mouthful of a job title, I know), and women in tech has always been a point of interest for me, so that's a bonus. I'd also have a chance to pick a technical project to work on, so I have fodder for a work term report, as well as something to slam on a resume (bonus points!). A lot of the work seems to be regarding logistics with events that WiCS organizes for, well, WiCS, and outreach to high schools in order to encourage more girls to enrol - which I'm totally okay with, because I feel like I'm good at that kind of thing. I even felt like I could properly justify why I was more qualified than others for this job - I helped organize a 'girls in tech' club before in high school, and was in charge of teaching coding and handling outreach. This whole gig is my jam, dude.

When I first heard that I got the interview during reading week, I had pretty conflicted feelings about it all - I desperately want to work a dev job because I just wanted to *learn* my first co-op term, but going into reading week I'd heard that Microsoft had been sending out offers to people for Explore already (I, as predicted, did not receive one of those emails). I was really happy that I had another interview because I know that the first co-op is the hardest to get, I should be glad I'm even getting interviews in main round, but I was also kind of sad that it wasn't a dev job.

Fortunately, when I first got it, I brought it up with my sister and my close friend in fourth-year who's been through the spin cycle of co-op. My sister brought up a really good point that it'd be a good opportunity to be on campus, as it would let me stay close to home and I could also catch up in terms of courses so I wouldn't be behind. I actually brought this up during the interview as a possibility, and it was really exciting - my (potential) supervisor actually encouraged it, even though it was a day course. She said that she normally encourages people in this position to take a course in order to take advantage of the fact that they're on campus, and that my hours could be flexible to work around that. Meanwhile, my fourth-year friend brought up a really good point that I could treat this as a huge networking opportunity. By working outreach and talking to a bunch of women in tech and also just in general having a good point of contact with the university with this supervisor (who actually sits on the executive council for CS because that's how much gender is an issue), I'd have an opportunity to work with a lot of interesting people and get to know plenty of people who may potentially hook me up with a job in later terms. Very useful.

I'd be pretty sad if I didn't get this job.

Tomorrow, I have an interview with Scotiabank, as an associate business/programmer analyst in Toronto. I'm pretty confused on what the job actually entails, but this will actually be my first more "classic" interview - I'm actually going to dress up for business casual for this.

From what I've seen of others, working for a bank is a very typical first-year CFM job; as my now-working-in-a-startup friend who worked at TD his first term said, "banks love CFMs" - and I now see why. It's pretty much at the intersection of my degree with the computers and the finance, but we'll see how this goes tomorrow first.

I wonder if I'll like it as much as the job with the university.

Oh, and before we go - since this number probably won't change:

**Job count:** 50 jobs applied, 2 canceled by the employer, 39 rejections, 3 interviews, and 6 jobs that are just ... not hiring, apparently?

(Actually, in that 6 jobs is a dev job that's literally across the street from campus working full-stack that only 30 people applied for. I would have killed for that job. Why didn't they set up interviews ... Ah well.)
