Fun fact: slowly, quietly - it's been over a year since I "officially" started this blog.

I don't think I've stayed fully true to its original goal - I haven't carefully logged every dev goal I've had or accomplished, for example - but I do think it's kind of crazy I'm still writing here. Most of the time I can't keep my attention for too long on any one thing, but here I've actually managed to keep making posts over the past year.

I know a year and a handful of posts doesn't seem like much, but - we're getting there.

My main goal for the next year is to write about more stuff other than dev stuff. A couple weeks ago I actually went on /r/WritingPrompts and wrote a couple poems after not writing "official" poetry (I guess?) since I ended my internship with The YUNiversity - so maybe now we'll see more of me trying to write again.

Other than poetry, I'm also interested in writing other stuff: more professional stuff (like completing LinkedIn profiles!) and other stuff, like reviews about TV shows or games that I like.

It'll be a new year again, I guess.
