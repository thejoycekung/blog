Wow, it's almost been 3 months since I last updated this blog. Time for a quick catch-up!

(I'm currently writing this from my desk at work, so that's a small teaser into how productive I've been so far.)

In **March**, I started to finally get better from all the sick that half of February basically screwed me over with. We also pulled off a great concert for a cappella at the end of the month, so that was great!

In **April**, I basically worked hard to learn all the content from the 4 weeks in the middle of the term where I learned nothing. I passed all my courses, so that's what counts right?

I started my job as Assistant to the Director of Women in Computer Science at the beginning of May! So far, it's been really fun - I've helped organize a hackathon, an outreach event for middle-school girls, and two technical interview workshops for fellow university students.

By far the technical interview workshops have been the most fun, because I'm the one who gets to put together the list of questions, and I act as a sort of mentor to some of the students during the event. It's really exposed me to a lot of *Cracking the Coding Interview* that I ... probably wouldn't have looked at on my own, honestly. I think I might actually come to these next term when I'm on school, because they've been really useful.

Aside from all that, though, I haven't done a whole lot of other stuff. We're organizing a sort of sexism response workshop based on *Theatre of the Oppressed* by August Boal, which was a fascinating read, and starting to get applicants to go to the annual Grace Hopper Celebration in October. I'm also starting to look at ideas for my technical project this term, so I can actually start writing my work term report.

Work has been slow this past week, though, so instead of logging 30+ hours on Facebook each week, I'm starting to delve back into [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I first started this probably over two years ago, wanting to get into more back-end web development and learn Ruby and Rails, but I think using a Windows machine just made everything so. Incredibly. Hard.

Thankfully, I work on a Mac at the office, and I've pretty much fully transitioned to using Elementary OS at home (although my Windows partition still exists, just in case). Unix terminals rule my life now.

Now, on attempt 2 of trying to do the Odin Project, I actually got through the installation process of step 1 (the intro!!!) and hopefully I'll be able to finish the courses by the end of the term. Fingers crossed!

In other news, it's my birthday next week, and I bought myself a [Ringly Go](https://ringly.com/products/go) to celebrate. That's, like more than $200 down the drain, but hey, you only turn 19 once.

Hopefully I'll update this blog more often with more adventures from my co-op term!
