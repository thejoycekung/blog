Wow, it's almost been two months into my job!

It's an odd feeling - things are kind of winding down event-wise because school is starting to ramp up for students, which means less turnout, so we're basically done now. However, we're starting to work on some great things for the coming Fall and Winter Terms, which I'm really excited for.

First off, we organized applications to attend the annual Grace Hopper Celebration in October under WiCS funding! GHC will be held in Orlando this year, so I'm incredibly excited for everything that will happen in those 3 days - and potentially fourth, which we may spend walking around Orlando, or at Disney, or something similar ...
Nevertheless, we're taking 39 other girls (besides myself) under the WiCS umbrella, and I'm really glad that I have the chance to go! I've heard so many great things about GHC, and I'm unbelievably excited to be able to attend myself.

Second, we're starting to push to create a Technovation chapter here at UW for local KW kids. I've worked with Technovation in the past - I'm pretty sure it's what helped me get this job in the first place - but this time, Jo has asked me to look into other material besides the Scratch/MIT App Inventor stuff that's been available. So, I've been taking the Android Basics Udacity courses! This is really awesome for me, because #androidfangirl and I'm really glad that this aspect of what I love is able to intersect with my job, even though I wasn't really expecting to do any major coding or learning to code here.

In other, less co-op related things, I've been selected to be a Head Pink Tie Leader for this year's Orientation in September, I'm still doing lots of stuff with a cappella, I'm still working on The Odin Project on my own, I'm still taking a class, and I'm planning a trip to Yellowstone National Park with my family later this summer. 

One thing at a time.

I'm so incredibly excited for orientation this year - our team's name is going to be 'Big Boolean' (as opposed to 'Big Ben') and I had a chance to meet the rest of my team leaders and my other Head Pink Tie, and they all seem like incredibly fun people. We did this Amazing-Race style team-building exercise last Saturday morning, and I'm so glad I had that chance to get to know and work with them. I know that orientation will be great with them - I just hope that our first-years agree as well!

In a cappella, being in the AcaBellas is a great experience. It's so odd to go to such a small group after being in the 60-70-strong ACE for the past two terms, but it's a new experience and I'm really happy I got to do it. We performed at ACE's coffeehouse last week, and my old musical director from ACE (who's now graduated) said that I sounded a lot better than when he first heard me sing in the fall. I think that's something to really be proud of. I'm also a part of two small groups this term, who will (hopefully!) be performing at our End-of-Term Concert in a few weeks, and I was approached to be part of another small group in the coming fall. Honestly, I'm so glad I've been able to be a part of this giant group of singing nerds.

The Odin Project has been going well - I kind of put it on hold for a couple weeks when personal things in my life got a little too heavy and work was ramping up, but I've gotten to the part where I'm learning JavaScript on Codecademy now. Not a bad place to be, to be honest. And in school, I haven't been to class in a week or so, but that's okay - I'll fix that tomorrow, haha.

As for the trip planning, I'm really, really excited for Yellowstone this summer. I haven't had a chance to go home and visit my family a lot this term between work and a cappella, so I'm really excited to be able to spend almost (more?) than an entire week with them in the US. It's still pretty funny how it's Canada 150 so there's free parks admissions, but here we are, going to the US. Ah, well.  

I think the part that I'm most excited for, besides the classic attractions like Old Faithful and the Canyon, is the fact that there's going to be a solar eclipse as we drive over. The last one happened in 1979, and the next one is in 2024, so I'm just crazy excited - this is a *literal* once in a lifetime experience. How often can you say that?

I think last year around this time I was pretty happy, because I wasn't in school, and I was looking forward to university.

This year, I'm happy to be taking chances with new friends that I've made in a place where I'm doing okay, and going places I've literally and figuratively never been before.

It's exciting.

P.S. I can legally drink in Ontario now, so I've been taking advantage of that every time I go out to eat with my friends. I have to figure out what my favourite drink is!
