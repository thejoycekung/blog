Okay - so update on that website I said I was making.

It's hosted on my Github user website (too poor for real hosting - whoops) and I've been taking efforts to make it as minimalistic and clean as possible. At first I thought it would be a good place to show off cool colour schemes or CSS3 effects, but ... that just seems flashy and overdone. I've taken inspiration from [bettermotherfuckingwebsite](https://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com) and [HH Websites and Resumes](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1487708811477672/) because a lot of the websites shown there are really simple, well-designed, *and* informative without being cluttered (my favourite is [Will Strimling's](https://willium.com) - although [Ryan Morrison's](https://ryry.io/) is also gorgeous).  

Now comes the hard part - the content.

You'd think that for a girl who loves writing, reading poetry, used to *actually* write informally for a Medium publication, and has blogged on some level for the past five years, I'd be more comfortable about writing.

Think again!

Writing about my professional - and academic! - experiences in a way that is self-reflective yet also showcases my skills in a way that makes me seem employable has always been a weakness of mine. Most of the time, I can't look back on *any* old writing of mine because it activates some level of absolute cringe inside myself thinking about my past work and experiences. Maybe that says more about myself and my inability to self-reflect over the long term, but it's a pretty big problem when the only way most people will ever want to get to know you is if they know what you've done before.

Making this blog and keeping it semi-regularly over the last six(ish) months has certainly helped, but the fact remains that I still have to fill that landing page with something a little bit more.

Or at least increase the font size and spacing (always a viable option). ðŸ˜›
