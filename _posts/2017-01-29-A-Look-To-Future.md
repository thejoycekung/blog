# ... And a Look to the Future.

=======================================

Which brings us to 2017.

In 2017 so far, I have done ... just about nothing. As a co-op student at Waterloo, I'm currently trying to find my first job for the summer (and if any kind stranger on the Internet void happens to be reading this, I'm still unemployed as of yet!). People are posting their resumes everywhere and I'm feeling the dreaded feeling of impostor's syndrome creeping up on me again - except this time I know that it's *real*, because I *am* an impostor in this world of people my age, in my affiliated programs, being so much more capable, knowing so much more, and doing so much more with the same amount of time that I have.

This term, school has led me to start learning C, and yesterday I installed Linux ([Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/), which is gorgeous) on my computer on a whim (and I don't know if I'll ever go back to Windows after this). I also wrote my first-ever TeX file (a simple "Hello, World" type thing, but better than nothing). Today, I signed up to be a member of Google's [Women Techmakers](https://www.womentechmakers.com/), and I'm starting this blog to document my dev adventures (coding, CS, projects, co-op, and otherwise).

Last year I tried to start a Markdown file, 'Coding Goals'. It's since been lost somewhere in the other OS on my computer (the other ether, you might say?), but now that I have a proper blog (!), I can try holding myself to them. So without further ado, my list for 2017:

1. Sharpen my skills.
    This means HTML/CSS! HTML5 and CSS3 are newfangled things that I Should Learn, especially if I want to be able to keep putting HTML/CSS on my resume, LOL. That Python course also won't learn itself.
2. Get better with the terminal.
    Being on Windows all my life and not very good with actual computer things, the terminal is a place of horror for me. After I installed Linux yesterday, I had to spend half an hour using it to troubleshoot my wifi connection. I then proceeded to use it to install a bunch of .deb files I needed to actually be able to use this computer. 
    I have a feeling I'm going to get way better at using it this year.
3. Use HackerRank/LeetCode/etc to try and ramp up my algorithm solving skills.
    I bought a copy of **Cracking the Coding Interview**, the famed book for coding interviews, so I might as well put some practice in.
4. Finish my project (or at least ship a WIP version!) on Lin-Manuel Miranda's tweets.
5. Sharpen up my Java skills, and write an Android app.
    Over the past year, I've realised that by far my favourite platform/OS is Android. It's highly customizable, built by the legendary Google, and incredibly aesthetically pleasing (helloooo, material design!). It's also highly fragmented, and in dire need of a solid messaging strategy, but I just want to be able to say: it's not just that I'm a "highkey Android fangirl", as [my Twitter bio states](https://twitter.com/seeroflights), but I'm also an Android dev, and I love it.
6. Participate in Google's Summer of Code 2017.
    I did Google Code-In in 2015, which successfully disqualified me from participating in SoC 2016, since GCI ended in January 2016. GSoC is really where it's at, though, since GCI was just a stepping stone to get there.
7. Keep reading. Keep learning. Keep absorbing.
