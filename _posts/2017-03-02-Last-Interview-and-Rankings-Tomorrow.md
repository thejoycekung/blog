# Last Interview, and Rankings Tomorrow

Just got out of my Scotiabank interview a little under an hour ago, so let's do a quick debrief.

The job itself seems interesting - it seems to be highly centred around building/maintaining systems and infrastructure to supplement large global trading (!finance!). This is coincidentally an area I know next to nothing about (!learning!). It's also in downtown Toronto, and they hire a *ton* of co-op students, so bonus points for city life and being able to get to know other co-ops. They also seem to take care of their co-ops pretty well, because they do career workshops, how project management works and software development life cycle and stuff like that, which is great, because let's be real - CFM isn't going to teach me that in class.

My interviewer seemed really nice, and it was pretty obvious that he really loved his job, too. Looking at my major he even offered to consider me for the development position they're also hiring in, which is crazy great because yes, please hire me. Anywhere. Everywhere. He even gave me a pamphlet/brochure that a past co-op had put together about co-op at Scotiabank, in addition to his own business card (not even Microsoft did that - although, Microsoft *is* Microsoft, the brand speaks for itself).

I think overall the interview went pretty well, but there were some aspects that were a little fishy - he was probably looking for more in terms of my answers on what I'd want to get from the job in terms of knowledge or experience, which is totally fair.

Also - he asked me a semi-technical question after learning that I've used C and Java, and was getting acquainted with Unix/Linux on which languages I'd use to manage/manipulate a large set of data, and what system I'd use to do so as well. I gave the right answers of C/Linux, but my justifications were pretty shoddy ... as is my knowledge of either.

I was also a tad overenthusiastic at the end when I said I rated my interest as a 10, but hey - I'm desperate to be employed, man. Gotta do what you gotta do.

Finally, fun fact: I actually brought the wrong version of my resume to the interview, which I realised as soon as I walked in and shook his hand. As a CFM student, I have both a CS and Finance resume prepared, since the requirements in terms of layout are preeeetty different, but I accidentally brought the CS one (since that was what I thought the job was!) instead of the finance one, which was sitting on the desk when I walked in. Awkward. Thankfully, I didn't take my resume out of the folder I had it in, so my shame never had to be revealed. Woops.

Anyways, rankings will be revealed tomorrow. I know for sure that Microsoft, at least, will leave me unranked (\*single tear\*), but Scotiabank and the University are still open. Here's to seeing at least someone giving me a rank of 1 tomorrow (aka an offer) :)
