title: Four Co-op Terms Later, Finding Some Direction

Here I am again.

It's been an absolutely wild ride this term. I spent the better part of 2018 in Toronto, so _not_ being there has been ... a huge shift. Not only am I in a totally different city, but this is also my first time ever being in San Francisco/the Bay Area.

Naturally, I had to try and take advantage of it as much as possible. I've done a lot this term, from all the touristy things (like Golden Gate Bridge and Park, Fisherman's Wharf) to artsy things (seeing several concerts, watching Hamilton, SFMoMA) to travelling outside of the city (Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe, and Yosemite National Park). I've tried my best to jam as much of the city as I can into four months, and looking back ... I think I've done a pretty good job.

For now, though, I don't think I want to be returning to the Bay Area or San Francisco. It was fun for a term; it was cool to be here; I don't think I can handle living here again though. If I come back to this city, I'd hope it's simply as a tourist. There's ... a lot of homeless people, and the streets and BART aren't exactly the cleanest. Maybe South Bay is better - I've heard good things - but I'm definitely not ready to settle down there yet.

That being said, I don't know just yet if I'm going to go back to Toronto next term. The USA is still full of good opportunities (and money), and I plan on living in Toronto while full-time, so we'll see where the job search brings me so far.

Speaking of my job, I think I've done a lot at my co-op term this time around. I'm really happy - I never got to do the platform work I was promised in my last co-op, and this term has basically been consumed by it. I've been working on build automation and improving build pipelines on Gitlab CI and reducing app size and - this is the kind of stuff that gets me excited.

I'm not really sure how I didn't notice this pattern before. In my first co-op, I wanted to improve processes - so I did so the only way I knew how to, by completing re-writing the co-op handbook. In my second co-op, I wanted to improve our testing effectiveness - so I did so by writing scripts about our test suite. In my third co-op, I _literally signed up for a **platform** job_.

At the start of this term, I was seriously considering project management. I figured I was semi-decently organized; I know how to talk to people/stakeholders; I can keep people on track. But over the course of this term through my development (as a developer) I've learned that it's not just project managers who can improve process so that other developers can develop better - it's also people who work in stuff like _infrastructure_, and _devops_.

You might be wondering: how on earth have I not noticed this field of development yet?

Well, the simple answer is ... I haven't come in contact with many "devops" engineers, to be very honest with you. At my previous workplaces, the work of a DevOps engineer was often just owned by the most senior person on the team (be it a technical lead or an engineering manager). Things from altering CI jobs to changing the deploy process - things that _I've_ been working on this term, things that my technical lead has been helping me with - these are things that I always thought of as more of a manager or senior engineer's responsibility.

When I first started this term, I wasn't exactly sure what I was going to be diving into. They'd told me that they wanted me to own a project from start to finish, and I'd like to think that by this point I've owned a few. I didn't know what kind of project I was going to be taking on - all I knew (a few weeks in) was that I'd prefer not to work on the UI (a wise choice, I've since learned). I chose not to choose a more "backend" project, even though I felt like that would give me more experience in Android development - wasn't that why I signed up to come here, anyway? - but a "build"-level project. Like I said, I'd only ever seen senior engineers working on this kind of stuff, so I figured there would be very minimal chances for me to come into contact with this in the future. If they're offering me the process as my sandbox, why _not_ take advantage of it?

Now I'm trying to think of next steps. Who should I talk to? What kind of LinkedIn Learning videos should I watch? Where am I going with this path? What kind of paths _are_ there from here? DevOps, even on the internet, seems like a vague, nebulous thing that comes in many forms and shapes and sizes.

I don't know. But I feel like, for maybe the first real time in my time in co-op, I've found a niche that I actually enjoy - one that I would be willing to work for - at least a while in.

Maybe being a software engineer is pretty awesome after all.
