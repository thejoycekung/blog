# A (Pretty Late) Year in Review (Part I of II)
## In which I discuss last year's failures, and this year's hopes.

------------------------------------------------

2016 was only 29 days ago, but it seems like a lot longer from this side of the calendar. Most people write 'Year in Review' posts in December - anywhere from the 1st to the 31st, but then again, some of us are fashionably late.

(...If you can even call the 'hoodies and leggings' look fashionable.)

[//]: # (Arguably, January 29 is actually the second day of the Lunar New Year in 2017, so I am *technically* not late at all.)

In 2016, I chose to focus on school and myself rather than dev work. I didn't learn any new languages on my own. I didn't learn to use any new frameworks, didn't write any projects, didn't actually participate in any hackathons.

Instead, I graduated from high school, and the (as I look back now) ridiculous [International Baccalaureate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate) program. I spent a four-month summer cherishing the company of my friends, and freedom I knew I would never really get again. I got into and went to my first choice university program: Computing and Financial Management, at the University of Waterloo. I stopped playing the bassoon, and started to sing in an a cappella group instead. I became friends with fourth-years. I broke up with my boyfriend of a year. I failed my first university course (and thankfully, don't have to drop out).

Bit of a dip there towards the end of the year. Life got pretty hard by then, but I'm thankful that I had a solid support group.

I spent a lot of the year reading and absorbing, though. I watched the Google I/O livestream, read [/r/Android](http://reddit.com/r/Android) on the regular, joined the Facebook group Hackathon Hackers, listened to podcasts like [Vergecast](http://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast) and [Material](https://www.relay.fm/material), and kept up on [Product Hunt](http://producthunt.com) and [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

In the last quarter of the year, I had a chance to learn DrRacket thanks to the first-year CS courses offered at Waterloo, [a language based on LISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racket_(programming_language)), similar to MIT's [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)). I also volunteered at Waterloo's [Hack the North](https://hackthenorth.com) and had a chance to interact with so many hackers from all around the world and talk to them about what they were building (one team was working on an IoT hack for a microwave!). Last but not least, I learned from my mistakes in 2015, and successfully completed DigitalOcean's [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) challenge, earning a free (and incredibly soft!) T-shirt with plenty of stickers for my troubles. I tried starting a new project to document [@Lin_Manuel](https://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel)'s good morning and good night tweets, but this also happened to coincide with that dip in my personal life ... and over the winter break, I started Codecademy's Python course.

2016 was a long year, and I tried to take care of myself, but I know I can do more. Not only that, I know I can do better.
