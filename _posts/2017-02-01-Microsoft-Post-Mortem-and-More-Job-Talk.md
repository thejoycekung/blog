# Microsoft Post Mortem, and More Job Talk

So today was my interview for Microsoft's Explore program, and ... it wasn't overly horrible?

The good:
- Was given two ridiculously simple technical questions
- Successfully nerded out about tech obsessions (see: Android ! !! ! !)

The bad:
- Spent ***way*** too long on said simple technical questions
- Got a little bit tangential with said tech obsessions

There's a month until I hear back from them (even though they'll know their decision by tomorrow!), but I think in general, for a first (albeit pretty major) interview, it wasn't too bad. Just have to not completely choke when people ask me how to do things (because I know how to do them! probably!), and not let myself get too carried away, because even though they say this is a "little chat" with their interviewer, we all know it's a controlled, filtered chat.

In other news, I'm still otherwise interview-less, which kind of sucks, but the first round of jobs has barely finished, and I still have around a month (!) in order to get some more.

I also had a chance to go to [Flipp](https://flipp.com/)'s information session today (and grab a free t-shirt!) and got to learn a lot about them. I currently have a friend interning with them already, and she's frequently posting selfies, Snapchat/Instagram stories and photos about their culture.

Flipp is *very* culture oriented, as I discovered. Everything from their hiring process to their working style to their meetings to, literally everything. The company is built by four Waterloo grads, and I can tell that these are things that they probably valued themselves a lot when they were in co-op.

Anyways, it's 1:30AM right now, and tomorrow's going to be a long day - I have a cappella rehearsal (always a blast) and three assignments (!) to finish for Friday, so that's exciting.

**Job count**: 50 jobs applied, 1 job canceled by the employer (lol), 10 rejections, 1 interview.
