Happy October! We're approaching the middle of term now (if you couldn't feel it in the air from your nearby campus, already), and for some of us, it smells like assignments, midterms, and stress ... but for other, more fortunate souls like me, I just smell a lot of pumpkin/cinnamon themed items.

The middle of a co-op term always feels like a weird, exciting time for me. It's the point where you're most comfortable: you're finally into the rhythm of things - both during work and outside of it, and you haven't yet started considering your dreaded work term report. This term it's even more exciting - [we at Interaxon have something big coming as well](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpAvxnpAxAl).

Weirdly cryptic announcements aside, work has been good. I've transitioned over to the Muse App team, and I'm now working as an Android developer! It's been an interesting journey even to get to just this, but I'm really happy with how things have worked out and I wouldn't have it any other way. My fellow interns are also amazing - we go out for lunch/dinner weekly! - and my fellow coworkers in general are awesome people that are always willing to help me learn.

Outside of work, I'm continuing to work on that better person vibe. I'm still trying to swim regularly (note the word 'trying' - when will I be able to breathe with the strokes!), but I also now go rock climbing weekly with my friend. It's a challenge for sure (especially when I have minimal upper-body strength!), but I'm really happy with it, and I'm glad to be spending more time with her while I can.

I'm also trying to culture myself more! I've been to two musicals so far: a production of Heathers by the University of Toronto, and _Come From Away_ at the Royal Alexandra Theatre. Both were absolutely amazing, and I made a point to recommend everyone I know to go see and support the productions. I also went to Nuit Blanche a few weeks ago - my first time! I've always loved going to art galleries, so having a city-wide one where I could run around and look at a lot of large-scale art was incredibly fun. This coming week, I'll be seeing _Now You See Her_ at the Buddies in Bad Times theatre (which we saw a small model of at Nuit Blanche!), _Hadrian_ (during its world premiere run!) at the Four Seasons with the COC, and hopefully dropping by Art Toronto while it's still at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. Things have been busy, but they've been worth it.

Continuing on the theme of _culture_, I'm going to be flying off to Vietnam for a week in November! We'll be hitting up Hoi An and Hanoi while we're there, but I won't have the chance to see Ha Long Bay, I'm afraid - vacation time just isn't up for it. I'm excited, though, and I'm sure it's going to be amazing!

Last but not least, writing ... has been a thing. That I'm not doing regularly enough. I like to do day-to-day logs about work - that way after weeks I can actually remember what I've done - but I don't think I've done one in around 3 weeks. I should seriously catch up on that. I also wrote a [short fall poem](https://medium.com/@thejoycekung/just-peachy-f0df33513eb2) at the beginning of September, but haven't done much in terms of writing ... more.

Starting to think I should make it a calendar event just so I'd actually do it. Calendar events are how the world go round, right?
