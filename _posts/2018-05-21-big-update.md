title: A Life Update - Post-Mortem, 'Creating', and What Comes Next

Happy Victoria Day! I recognize that this isn't really a "holiday" in the sense that people actually celebrate it, but hey, getting the day off from school sounds great to me. Now that I have some time to breathe again since the recent onslaught of school, I thought I would take this time to update my blog (as inspired by job season, Anna Akana, and plain ol' boredom).

A few weeks ago I had my last day at [Influitive](https://www.influitive.com). I'm so incredibly thankful for the four months I had with them, and all the amazing people I got to work with - and all the things I got to learn. It was my first job in a "real" software related position, and I'm so glad for everything that happened. Even though it wasn't always sunshine and rainbows, I got a chance to see a lot more than I thought I would, which is going to help me immensely for my next job search. I passed around some cards - to people I still had a ton of lingering questions for, to people I didn't get a chance to talk to as much as I thought I would, to people who taught me more than I thought I'd learn - on that last day, and I'm really glad because most of them have decided to reply to me in some way, shape or form (is email too antiquated yet?). And I'm still learning about more things that I never would've found out if I didn't ask ...

To summarize most of what I've learned from Influitive:
- How the software development life cycle works
- Agile/Scrum processes (standup, grooming, retro)
- Ask people for coffee if you want to get to know them. Some people have some crazy origin stories.
- Don't be afraid to ask questions if you're confused. You're a child; people are here to help.
- Don't be afraid to ask for more work. Something boring might become your new project baby.
- Java (for the first time since high school)
- Belief in your product goes a longer way than salary, people, or work.

And it's that last point that's still guiding me right now in my job hunt. I realized pretty early on in my term at Influitive that I wasn't 100% onboard with the product that I was testing every single day, and it made it hard to stay focused and productive, even though I was working with amazing people, earning real money, and learning real practices. This term, I'm making it a priority to consider each company before applying, because I don't want to end up in a similar position again.

We'll see how that works out for me.

I'm sitting here writing again (completely ignoring the assignments I have to do) because not only did I realise I haven't updated this blog in a few months, but also because I recently watched [Anna Akana's latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVhiEc4kd0Q).

If you've never heard of Anna Akana, she's a Youtube vlogger who talks about a bunch of stuff - everything from feminism to mental health issues to her career as an actress and creator. She makes incredibly funny short films, animations for her own poetry, and owns a lot of cats. In short, she's pretty cool.

Her latest video is about taking the time to engage in "play", where you can just sit down and *do* something without worrying about time or how much money you'll earn off of it or who will appreciate it or - you get the idea. Play is something you do for yourself to relax your mind.

And I realised that for me, keeping some kind of life update alive is my play. Last term I wrote about what happened and what I did at work every week, to keep a log of what was actually happening, but since that's stopped in these last few weeks, I have a ton of residual thoughts that don't really get much time anywhere.

Except here, I guess.

So I'm out here to continue updating this blog whenever there's a little too much white noise in my mind. I'm out here to vent. I'm out here to complain. I'm out here to celebrate. I'm out here to write.

I can't guarantee how often, but I'm out here to write.

And I suppose that brings me to my final point. I called it "plain ol' boredom" in my intro, but really, a lot has been going on in my life. Last week I officially transferred to Computer Science from Computing and Financial Management (goodbye, finance!). I'm considering getting an English minor starting next Winter. I'm singing in 2 a cappella groups (possibly 2 more small groups, depending on how music and people work out), and I want to run for an exec position in at least one of them next Winter. I want to compete in the International Competition for Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA) in 2019. I want to get a developer position for Fall 2018. I want to pass all my classes this term.

And I guess, the smallest goal of all - I want to go to all of my lectures this term. Simple, I know, but as someone who has routinely skipped classes for at least 2 classes each term, who knows? 

Maybe this is what I need for a change.
