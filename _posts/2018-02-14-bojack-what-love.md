I've been watching BoJack Horseman on-and-off for the last month and a half, and it's ... made me feel things. Question things. Wonder if I'm actually happy with my own life.

For those who have never seen it before, BJH is set in a universe where animals co-exist with humans, and can walk and talk like them as well. The main character is the eponymous BoJack Horseman, who formerly starred in a TV show *Horsin' Around*, and is trying to figure out how to keep living his life. BoJack is a bad person who hurts the people around him, enables them to fall into bad habits, pushes people away even if they try to care ...

BoJack is a bad person. And it's funny how you can empathize with a protagonist who's very clearly Not Perfect - both because of his circumstances in the past, and his choices today - and realize how similar you are. 

Towards the end of season 3, BoJack is told by his best friend at the time: "It's not the alcohol, or the drugs, or any of the shitty things that happened to you in your career, or when you were a kid. It's you. [...] Fuck, man. What else is there to say?" (3.10)

What can you even say to that, coming from your best friend? There's something so raw about someone you trust saying to your face that *you* are what's wrong with you. Nothing else, no one else. Just you.

Maybe it's not funny how easy it is to empathize with him. Maybe it's scary, but the only way I know how to cope is humour.

It doesn't get any lighter from there. You can tell that BoJack wants to be better, but ... his actions don't agree with that. He fucks people up before people get to know him better, and it's on purpose so that they *can't* get to know him better. Because if they did, they wouldn't want to be around anyways. Isn't that something we can all understand on some level - wanting to be understood, but being too vulnerable to show people who we truly are inside? How are we to blame him for his intentions when we know we have the same ones?

But I guess the last point there is to make about BoJack Horseman is its love stories aren't perfect either. And it doesn't seem, at least for now, that any of them have a happy ending. The main one I want to talk about, though, is Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

Diane is the author of BoJack's biography, and Mr. Peanutbutter is BoJack's former rival, turned friend, and Diane's boyfriend (later husband). Diane is sarcastic, stubborn, an introvert, and Mr. Peanutbutter is happy-go-lucky, and extroverted to his core.

I don't know how to describe it. For me, watching Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter get married was like looking at two people I knew would eventually split. It wasn't just the intro/extroversion. It was the lack of communication - Mr. Peanutbutter's flair for the extravagant, Diane's wish to stay more lowkey instead. But they made it work. Somehow, they defied my expectations and made everything work. Even though they had fights. Even though Diane went away and came back early but only stayed at BoJack's house and didn't tell Mr. Peanutbutter. Even though Mr. Peanutbutter ran for Governor and explicity defied Diane's requests about fracking. Even through everything.

At the end of season 4, Diane breaks down and says, "Our marriage is like one of those Magic-Eye posters, [...] and it's messy. And at first glance, it doesn't seem to make any sense. And it's hard to figure out. But sometimes, if you squint at it *just* right, everything lines up, and it's the most perfect, beautiful, amazing thing. [...] But [her voice breaks] I'm so tired of squinting." (4.12)

I don't know what to say. People say that love is a decision, every day. And these two clearly had it, even if they didn't seem perfect for each other. So why do some people ... stop making that decision? What prompts someone to say, "I can't do this anymore"?

It's weird that I'm asking these questions now, when I myself have said those very words to other people before. I don't know what prompted me to say it - a soul-crushing draining feeling every time I talked to them, maybe? that sounds about right - but I also don't know why I said "I love you" in the first place. I don't know what love is. I don't know how to - maybe don't remember -

How do you stop blaming others for your own bad traits? How do you stop hurting people in a vain attempt to protect yourself? How do you fall in - how do you know - how do you love? How do you *stay* in love?

I don't know. 

And apparently, the characters on this show don't either.

Happy Valentine's day, then, I guess.
