... And in a blink of an eye, another month of this term has already passed by.

Some quick details to recap:
* This past weekend was the UWACC (UW A Cappella Club)'s Spring EOT (End of Term) concerts! It's my third one, and honestly, it's been the one that I've been able to absorb the least. It's so crazy to think that we've done it, we performed, and it... wasn't horrible. It was really good, apparently.
* My CECA advisor reached out to me and my supervisor about a midterm evaluation tomorrow. It's approximately 3 months in out of 4 ... but if you want to, sure thing.
* I had my last class of the term for Managerial Accounting last Thursday - which I promptly missed due to soundchecks from my a cappella concert. Oh well. You can't win them all.

Work is now starting to ramp down. We wrapped up what was pretty much our last major event of this term last Thursday, which was a meetup for incoming first-year female CS students. I'm pretty happy about it; I got to share a lot of my thoughts about my program to one girl who came out, and I got to meet a lot of girls who were a little nervous about CS at Waterloo and I got a chance to calm their thoughts. Overall - a pretty good event.

Now, though, we're back to the grind of dealing with GHC registrations and trying to figure out how to model the Android basics curriculum to the Technovation technical checklist. That second part is considerably harder than the first - it's hard because they have similar goals, but very different ways of approaching them.

In other news, I've also been trying to revamp my resume in time for Fall job-searching. I'm pretty happy with the design I've come up with, and now I want to put together a static one-pager using Github (as per usual) just to kind of write, "Hey world, I do things here sometimes. Come read about it, or shoot me an email about it". I'll use my user site repository for this, and hopefully it'll be halfway decent.

For now, though, I'm a little bit worried that my resume doesn't sound technical enough - but I guess that's what happens when you don't actually do that many side projects or do that well in school or even do that much technical work. We'll see how HH Websites and Resumes will roast me, though.

Until next month, I guess - and the end of my first co-op term!
