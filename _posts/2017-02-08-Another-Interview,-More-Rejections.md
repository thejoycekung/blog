# Another Interview, and More Rejections

I've gotten only one interview since I've last posted, and that's yet to be scheduled. It's for a front-end developer position, which is fine ... but it's also in Hong Kong.

GG. Apparently I can only get interviews for jobs that are incredibly far away.

I'm also still waiting for them to schedule it, because they canceled the interviews over webcam through campus recruitment (CECA) in favour of contacting us themselves.

... Still waiting for that email.

I've gotten 23 rejections so far, so excited to see how the rest of the month plays out! (Probably poorly.)

It's also midterm season right now, so I'm desperately trying to make sure that I'm not floundering in school like I did last term, and it's getting harder and harder every day ... My sleep schedule is starting to look rather odd (oversleeping is a horrible thing) and the amount of work/studying I've been doing is horribly low.

Sigh. Keep up with the grind.
