It's October 3rd, and tomorrow morning, I'll be going to Grace Hopper!

I'm super, super excited about all of this right now. It's been a pretty rough week leading up to this with tests, assignments, interviews, and midterms, and yesterday I had a pretty bad experience just thinking about how I was going to organize my time before coming here but - I'm here now! I have enough time to do my assignments! And I also have all the stuff I'll need :)

So just a bit of background on jobhunting this term: I'll be using WaterlooWorks mainly. I haven't been contacted externally by any company about getting an interview during the GHC Career Fair and even though I'm super interested in swag, I'm not entirely interested in being consumed by finding a job at the Career Fair, because I feel decently confident this term with WaterlooWorks. So far I've been scheduled for three interviews, two of which I've already done these past two days, so here's to getting more!

Anyways - back to Grace Hopper.

I didn't sleep last night, because the night before I had a nightmare that I got up at 8:53AM for our bus. The bus leaves at 4:30AM. It was not a good nightmare to have. So I ended up staying up all night, but that was okay, because I got a lot done! I ended up cleaning my room up a little bit, taking out the trash, and making breakfast (at 2:30AM). I'm particularly proud of that last one because I ended up finishing my bagels, arugula, and cream cheese, so I didn't have to throw any out before I left!

I met up with my friend who also lives on my street and we walked over together, and then we got to campus at around 10 to 4. People slowly trickled in with their luggage, and you could tell that everyone needed some sleep at some point. The bus ride was pretty uneventful, and customs/security was pretty easy - some people got Xs on their declaration cards so they had to wait in a 20 minute line, but we all made it through at a decent time, and boarded.

I spent most of the plane ride asleep. We landed a little bit early, though, which was great! I ended up finding out that I got an extension for one of my assignments due this week, and let my other friends know who are taking the course that that was an option for them. We ended up taking an Uber to the Orange County Convention Centre (OCCC) where GHC will be held, and it's crazy! There are *so many* GHC logos, banners, and signs up around the convention centre. I've never been to a con in general before, so it just seems so crazy and big.

Registration was super easy and fast, and then afterwards we just took an Uber back to our hotel and checked in. A lot of us just ended up eating lunch in the poolside restaurant, and then I went back to my room and met my roommate, another CFM student, but she's in 4th year - and this is her third GHC. We chatted a little bit and then I ended up napping just because I'm so tired. So tired.

When I woke up, I had a missed call - my interview. Thankfully it just came in, so I just called them back immediately. By this point my roommate had already gone to register at the OCCC, so I just did my interview and ended up letting her in towards the end.

Dinner tonight was a mix of Pringles and Arizona - hopefully tomorrow's fare will be better, whoops.

Plans for the rest of my night: finalizing my sessions for tomorrow!

Tomorrow, we take on the Grace Hopper Celebration. I'm so excited!
