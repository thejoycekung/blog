# Ranking and Match Day (AKA I'm Employed!)

(Edit: As a quick sidenote, happy International Women's Day! Seeing a lot of photos for A Day Without a Woman was pretty inspiring. I might write about it tomorrow as a sort of post-mortem, but for now you get this, which is already a day late - I blame my sickness.)

Last Friday was rankings day, where my interviewers ranked me on how much they'd want to hire me (or didn't, leaving me 'unranked'), and I got to rank them on how much I'd want to work for *them*.

It was kind of disappointing, to be honest. I'd been left unranked for both the Scotiabank and Microsoft positions, and although I was expecting it for the Microsoft position, I thought my Scotiabank interview had gone better. The one good thing was that at least I'd gotten ranked for the job at the university.

I ranked it a 1 (the highest rank I could give) and moved on with my day as best as I could, because everything afterwards was out of my control. I could basically just hope that the person who *did* get the offer opted for another job somewhere else.

Skip ahead to Tuesday, aka yesterday. Yesterday was match day, and it's the first time the new system has done matches, so I was really nervous and pretty unsure of when my match results would come out (or if they would even exist!). But by 9AM, the thread on Reddit went up about match results being out.

I got the university job !!

I was really unsure of whether it was actually Real(TM) because our co-op centre's website said that match results would be out by 4PM, but after confirming and reconfirming with people, it was definitely real. I'm employed for the next four months, starting in May, and ... dude, I'm going to have actual money to spend (on tuition) now.

I sent off an email to Jo (my future supervisor, the Director of Women in Computer Science) about my acceptance and some last questions to confirm about the job, and she got back to me by the end of the day.

One of the first things I'm going to be helping out with is an all-day hackathon for sixth-graders, and we're also having a HeForShe hack that same weekend. It'll be busy the first couple weeks.

Class times for next term also came out today, and since I'm on campus, I'll be able to make up the course that I couldn't take this term (because I'm retaking a course from last term). The *only* lecture slot that's available coincides with when my a cappella rehearsal is, though, so it looks like I'm either going to be giving aca up next term, or having to actually audition for another group.

Both ideas are equally scary.

For now, I'll enjoy the feeling of knowing I'm employed, and start scouring the web for some crazy technical project I should take on next term.

It'll be an interesting term.

Oh, and here's a conclusion I suppose:

**Job hunt**: 50 jobs applied, 2 canceled by the employer, 45 rejections, 3 interviews, 0 offers and 1 rank - one job. Thanks, RNG. You had my side.
