It's been six months since I last updated this blog, but a _lot_ has happened since. Here's a quick recap, to the best of my ability:
- Finished my 3A term! Passing is a different question.
- Found a job as an Android Engineer for Scribd, Inc. in San Francisco for May-August!
- Served as the Assistant Musical Director for the Acabellas, _and_ ...
- Competed in the International Collegiate Competition for A Cappella Quarterfinals!

On a more personal note, I also tried my hand at arranging music for a cappella for the first time, and got a new boyfriend.

I'm a little scared to move away to San Francisco for four whole months, but I figure, hey, if I can move to Waterloo, I can move a bit further across the country too.

Some big goals I have:
- Learn Python.  
I started learning Python end of last summer/beginning of last fall right before I started at my last co-op, but I kind of got distracted what with the new term beginning. My main goal with learning Python is just learning a more simple language for coding interviews, because we don't always need maximum memory management - sometimes just a simple script will do the trick.
- Learn some ASL.  
My boyfriend and I were talking about this while we were out for dinner once - we don't have a common language between us besides English, so it can be hard to communicate when we're sitting next to people we don't know (and don't want them to hear our conversations). There's a ton of online resources for this, so I'm interested to see how much I can learn.

We'll see how the term goes.
