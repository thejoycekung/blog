I got an interview! For Microsoft! And I almost, like, missed it!

Awkward.

Background:
1. I applied to a bunch of places on the job board that Waterloo uses ("WaterlooWorks", as it's called).
2. This year is its first year of actual implementation, and it's my first time using it too. Interviews are scheduled by the employer "selecting" you for an interview and you "confirming" the selection.
3. In Microsoft's case, they actually sent out emails (on *Friday*) taking you to a different portal to schedule your interview (and get extra knowledge about you). Emails that, at least Reddit confirms, ended up in the junk folder of everyone who got an interview.
4. This morning, my recruiter called me (all the way from Redmond, WA!) *while I was busy applying to more internships* and she ended up having to leave a voicemail. Incredibly awkward.

Thankfully after that fiasco, I got my sh*t together and submitted a confirmation for an interview slot, and then proceeded to freak out.

The position is an internship under Microsoft's Explore program, which is for first- and second-year students, and an opportunity to get an idea of different kinds of dev roles within a large company.

This is my first Real(TM) interview, and I'm pretty scared, because:
1. I have yet to do any actual interviews yet.
2. I have yet to do any actual coding interviews yet.
3. Interviews that I've done in the past for misc high school club exec positions have consisted of multiple flubs before solidifying. i.e. every year, it's third time the charm.
4. What if I don't get another interview after this one ???

I'm pretty anxious about it, but I've reading up on *Cracking the Coding Interview* today (since I had the foresight to buy it earlier this month!) and I've talked to a friend who did this position last year, so fingers crossed for things to go well!

More later today (if I remember) on *Cracking the Coding Interview* because seriously, some of the stuff Gayle McDowell points out is hella true.
