WHY WON'T YOU RENDER, CSS. WHY?

---------

UPDATE:

CSS rendered. Everything (other than broken links and such) works.

A quick TL;DR: of what happened since my last "oh wow this is confusing" post:  
1. I uploaded everything onto my actual User Pages site.  
2. I un-uploaded everything (removed?) from my actual User Pages site because I figured out how to use baseurl in Jekyll. Hell yeah.  
3. I got a Bootstrap theme and favicon - shoutout to [Clean Bootstrap](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) and their theme for Jekyll blogs, and [Endless Icons](http://www.endlessicons.com/free-icons/book-icon/) for the favicon.  
4. I started editing the Bootstrap theme - changed the post font to Merriweather. I'm not a fan of the kerning on Lora.

As of now, the Bootstrap theme makes everything pretty and such, but I want to make it my own, so here's a list of to-dos:  
1. Modify the navbar so that instead of my blog title showing in the top corner, it's a "&larr; back to home" so that whenever my actual portfolio goes up, it can go there. Something similar with the right corner as well.  
2. Modify the footer, so that the links will actually work.  
3. Get some other stock images. Unsplash anyone?

Anyways, school starts up again tomorrow and I should probably apply to more jobs before main round closes on Tuesday morning (I still have 50 applications to use). Time to put this down (at least for now) and remember that I'm a student.
